***Partage ton Pain*** (*Share your Bread* in French) is a charitable organization that was founded in 2024 with a goal of helping the underprivileged, particularly those experiencing homelessness. Based in Montreal, it operates throughout Canada.

Our primary objective is to alleviate poverty by providing food, clothing, hygiene items and other essentials of life to individuals and families living in poverty, on low incomes, or in need, especially the homeless.
